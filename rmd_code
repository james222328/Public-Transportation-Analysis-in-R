# Objective 1: Satisfaction Levels Between Daily and Non-Daily Users

```{r load-data-1, echo=TRUE}
# Load the data
data <- read.csv("Responses.csv")

# Print column names
print(colnames(data))
```

```{r t-test, echo=TRUE}
# Split data into daily and non-daily users
daily_users <- data[data$How.often.do.you.use.public.transport. == "Daily", ]
non_daily_users <- data[data$How.often.do.you.use.public.transport. != "Daily", ]

# Perform t-test
t_test_result <- t.test(
  daily_users$How.satisfied.are.you.with.the.public.transport.service.overall.,
  non_daily_users$How.satisfied.are.you.with.the.public.transport.service.overall.
)

# Print the t-test result
print(t_test_result)
```

**Conclusion:**  
The p-value is slightly greater than 0.05, suggesting that there is no statistically significant difference in satisfaction levels between daily and non-daily users.

# Objective 2: Satisfaction Levels by Transport Type

```{r anova-setup, echo=TRUE}
# Load required library
library(stats)

# Convert transport type to a factor
data$Transport_Type <- as.factor(data$What.type.of.public.transport.do.you.use.most.often.)

# Perform one-way ANOVA
anova_result <- aov(
  How.satisfied.are.you.with.the.public.transport.service.overall. ~ Transport_Type,
  data = data
)

# Print ANOVA summary
print(summary(anova_result))
```

**Conclusion:**  
The ANOVA result shows a p-value less than 0.05, indicating a significant difference in satisfaction levels across different types of public transport.  

## Visualization: Average Satisfaction by Transport Type

```{r anova-plot, echo=TRUE}
# Load ggplot2 for visualization
library(ggplot2)

# Plot average satisfaction by transport type
ggplot(data, aes(x = Transport_Type, y = How.satisfied.are.you.with.the.public.transport.service.overall.)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun = "mean", fill = "lightblue", color = "darkblue") +
  labs(
    title = "Average Satisfaction by Transport Type",
    x = "Transport Type",
    y = "Average Satisfaction Score"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

# Objective 3: Relationship Between Age and Satisfaction Level

```{r correlation-analysis, echo=TRUE}
# Load required libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(corrplot)

# Compute correlation
correlation_matrix <- cor(data$Age, data$How.satisfied.are.you.with.the.public.transport.service.overall.)
print(paste("Correlation between Age and Satisfaction Level:", correlation_matrix))
```

**Interpretation:**  
A weak positive correlation (r = 0.2222) exists between age and satisfaction level, suggesting that older individuals tend to have slightly higher satisfaction levels.

## Visualization: Age vs. Satisfaction Level

```{r scatter-plot, echo=TRUE}
# Scatter plot with linear regression line
ggplot(data, aes(x = Age, y = How.satisfied.are.you.with.the.public.transport.service.overall.)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "green") +
  labs(
    title = "Scatter Plot of Age vs. Satisfaction Level",
    x = "Age",
    y = "Satisfaction Level"
  )
```

**Caution:**  
Correlation does not imply causation. Other factors may independently influence both age and satisfaction level.

# Summary

1. **Objective 1:** No significant difference in satisfaction levels between daily and non-daily users.
2. **Objective 2:** Significant differences in satisfaction levels across transport types.
3. **Objective 3:** Weak positive correlation between age and satisfaction level.
